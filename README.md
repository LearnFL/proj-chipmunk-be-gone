This is a small and fun project I built with my kid to keep chipmunks out of a strawberry garden.

I used what I had available at that time, if you are ready to invest a little bit more time, effort and money you can definitely make it more exciting.
It would defintely be great to make owl move its wings.

With that being said I 3d printed a basic owl that I found on thingsgivers.com and I had a linear actuator that I found on thingsgivers.com and printed a while back.

I used Adafruit Audio FX and a small 8 Om speaker to play owl sound that I found on internet. I built an audio amplifier for the speaker, if you don't feel like soldering you can just buy one.

I used a mosfet to turn on and off servo to save the power.

When PIR sensor senses motion the owl jumps, its eyes flash and it plays owl sounds.

I used Atmega-328P controller off the board so my kid could practice soldering.
